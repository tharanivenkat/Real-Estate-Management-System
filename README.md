# real-estate-management-system
The Real Estate Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline the management of real estate properties, agents, and office locations. It offers an efficient and scalable solution for real estate businesses by providing a structured approach to handling property listings, agent details, and office information. The system is built using Node.js and Express.js, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This modular design ensures clean separation of concerns, making the application more maintainable and scalable.

The backend handles the business logic through dedicated controllers such as agentController.js and officeController.js. These controllers manage CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for real estate agents and office locations. The application also uses RESTful APIs to facilitate seamless data exchange between the frontend and backend. The database interactions are managed through connection.js, which ensures smooth communication with the data storage system.

The database design is supported by an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, which defines the relationships between the core entities: properties, agents, and offices. The properties table stores details such as property ID, location, price, and status. The agents table contains agent-specific information like name, contact, and assigned properties, while the offices table maintains office details. The ER diagram effectively maps out the relationships, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

The application offers key functionalities, including adding, updating, and retrieving property listings, managing real estate agents, and organizing office locations. The use of Node.js allows for efficient handling of asynchronous operations, while Express.js ensures a lightweight and flexible backend framework. Additionally, middleware functions are used for error handling and authentication, enhancing the security and reliability of the system.

By implementing RESTful APIs and adhering to MVC architecture, the system ensures smooth and organized data flow, making it highly scalable and maintainable. Overall, this project provides a reliable platform for real estate businesses to efficiently manage their operations, improving productivity and organization through a user-friendly and robust web-based solution.
